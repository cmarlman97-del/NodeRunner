# Contact Manager Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack contact management application built with React, Express, and TypeScript. The application allows users to create, view, search, and delete contacts through a modern web interface. It uses a PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for data persistence and features a clean, responsive design with shadcn/ui components.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The client-side is built with React and TypeScript, following a component-based architecture:

- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod for validation

The frontend follows a clean separation of concerns with dedicated directories for components, pages, hooks, and utilities. Components are organized into UI primitives and feature-specific components.

### Backend Architecture

The server-side uses Express.js with TypeScript in an ESM module setup:

- **Framework**: Express.js for HTTP server and API routes
- **Architecture Pattern**: RESTful API design with resource-based endpoints
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database operations
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based storage layer supporting both in-memory (development) and database implementations
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between client and server for consistent data validation
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware with proper HTTP status codes

### Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main entities:

- **Contacts**: Core entity storing contact information (name, email, phone, company)
- **Users**: User authentication entity (username, password)

Both tables use UUID primary keys generated by PostgreSQL's `gen_random_uuid()` function.

### Development Setup

The application is configured for both development and production environments:

- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR, in-memory storage for rapid prototyping
- **Production**: Built static assets served by Express with database persistence
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations

### API Design

RESTful API endpoints following standard conventions:

- `GET /api/contacts` - Retrieve all contacts
- `GET /api/contacts/:id` - Retrieve specific contact
- `GET /api/contacts/search?q=term` - Search contacts
- `POST /api/contacts` - Create new contact
- `DELETE /api/contacts/:id` - Delete contact

All endpoints include proper error handling, validation, and consistent JSON responses.
